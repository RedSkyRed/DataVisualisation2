    <h3> What is Worlds?</h3>
    <p>
    League of Legends runs a yearly comptetiition where the best of the best come together to play against one another and claim the championship cup. With money, fame and pride on the line, its an honour for a team to even attend this event.
    Only 16 teams make it to this event, having to compete in thier respective country leagues in order to qualify for this event. In 2022, we have this year 4 teams from China, 4 teams from Korea, 3 teams from Europe, 3 from North America,
    1 from the Pacific and 1 from Vietnam. Among those teams, a Korean team by the name of SKT T1 has qualified for Worlds 2022 this year.

    <h3>Who is SKT T1?</h3>
    <p>
        SKT T1 is a powerhouse team. A team that has attended Worlds Events more times then not. Not only do they consistenly qualify, they also the hold title of the most Worlds wins held by any team, winning 3 times in 2013, 2015 and 2016.
        They are a team that have been around for awhile. Additionally they have won thier respective regional leagues 10 times, meaning that they have proven themselves time and time again to be the best in Korea.

<h3> How are they going?</h3>
<p>
    As shown above, we can see the respective performance of the top 8 teams, based on thier Win/Loss ratio coming into Worlds 2022. As we can see, no player in particular really stands out from SKT T1's line up in terms of roster this year,
    besides SKT T1's jungler Oner, who has a higher Kill/Death/Assist (KDA) on average then other junglers from other high performing teams. Most other team mates actually have very average performance throughout the year for thier respective role.
    While other teams will have one or two stand out members who excel in thier field, perhaps SKT T1's strength relies less on the performance on its individual players, but more on thier performance as as team. 
    In contrast teams such as Gen.G have been overperforming, with clear strengths across multiple individual players, they are highly favoured to win this years Worlds 2022.
